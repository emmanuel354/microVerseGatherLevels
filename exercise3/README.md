Create a variable `n` with the value 71.
Create an `if` statement that detects if  variable `n` is greater than 45.
Inside that `if` statement, create another `if` statement that detects if the same variable is smaller than 65.
Inside that `if` statement, add a `console.log` that shows the value of the variable `n`.
The value of `n` will not show initially even if you hit “Run”.
Change the value of `n` until it shows on the terminal.
