Create an empty array called `arr`
Create a `for` loop that loops from 3 to 12.
On every step of that loop, push the value of `i` into the array.
At the end of the loop, `console.log` the value of `arr` after all those values have been pushed into it.
The output should show an array with the values [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
